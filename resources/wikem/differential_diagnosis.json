Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are both highly contagious and spread by direct contact with secretions or contact with contaminated objects. Infected individuals should not share handkerchiefs, tissues, towels, cosmetics, linens, or silverware. The safest approach to prevent spread to others is to stay home until there is no longer any discharge, but this is not always feasible for most students nor for those who work outside the home. Most daycare centers and schools require that students receive 24 hours of topical therapy before returning to school. Such therapy will probably reduce the transmission of conjunctivitis due to bacterial infection but will do nothing to reduce the spread of viral infections.\n\nI have recommend to this patient to consider that their problem is like a cold, and their decision to return to work or school should be similar to the one they would make in that situation. Those who have contact with the very old, the very young, and immune-compromised individuals should take care to avoid spread of infection from their eye secretions to these susceptible people. Further questions about when to return should be addressed to the patient's primary care provider at follow-up."
